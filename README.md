## TODO

* ~~Render a sine wave in two.js~~

* ~~Add controls to change frequency and amplitude~~

* ~~Draw subtick marks~~

* Draw labels on the grid

* Change the sine wave in time using an animation

  * Play and pause buttons


* ~~Show equation on page in LaTeX~~

* ~~Make frequency and amplitude inputs use LaTeX~~
